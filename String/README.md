<p align="justify">String - my implementation of a string class based on const char*. The standard C-operators were used to work with C-strings. Also added constructor from initialization list to make it possible to set string via curly braces. Everything is decomposed. Files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inc/String.h - header file with the declaration of the class and all necessary functions.</li>
  <li>src/String.cpp - implementation file with the definition of all class's functions.</li>
  <li>src/test.cpp - test file.</li>
  <li>CMakeLists.txt - build file.</li>
</ul>
