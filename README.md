<p>This repository contains all of the mini-projects that I did to assimilate the material that I have learned by pluses.</p>

<p>1. String - my implementation of class string. Decomposed. All files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>inc/String.h - header file with the declaration of the class and all necessary functions.</li>
  <li>src/String.cpp - implementation file with the definition of all class's functions.</li>
  <li>src/test.cpp - test file.</li>
  <li>CMakeLists.txt - build file.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. BigInt - my implementation of a class big integers. Decomposed. All files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>inc/BigInt.h - header file with the declaration of the class and all necessary functions.</li>
  <li>src/BigInt.cpp - implementation file with the definition of all class's functions.</li>
  <li>src/test.cpp - test file.</li>
  <li>CMakeLists.txt - build file.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Shapes - project with a hierarchy of basic geometric 2D shapes. Decomposed. All files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>inc/Point.h - header file with the declaration of the Point-class and overloading output stream.</li>
  <li>inc/Shapes.h - header file with the declaration of the shapes' classes and all necessary functions.</li>
  <li>src/Point.cpp - implementation file with the definition of the Point-class and overloaded output stream.</li>
  <li>src/Shapes.cpp - implementation file with the definition of the shapes' classes and all necessary functions.</li>
  <li>src/test.cpp - test file.</li>
  <li>CMakeLists.txt - build file.</li>
</ul>
